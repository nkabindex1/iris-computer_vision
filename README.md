Computer Vision with Deep Learning: Iris Flower Classification
--------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a Python implementation of a computer vision project that focuses on classifying iris flowers using deep learning techniques. The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different species of iris flowers based on their images. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and this project extends it to the realm of computer vision.

Project Overview
-----------------
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Preparation: The Iris dataset is preprocessed and transformed into images suitable for deep learning.

Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed and trained to classify iris flowers.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various metrics to assess its performance.
